# Fresh California Avocados

As a native Californian I know it can be especially difficult to get fresh avocados all over the country, all year long. I have created this sample sample application utilizing Stripe Checkout to demo a web application that would allow people to order their avocados straight from California!

## Running the project

1. Build the server (navigate to the project file in terminal)

```
npm init
npm install express --save
npm install --save stripe
```

2. Run the server

```
node server.js
```

3. Go to [http://localhost:4242/checkout.html](http://localhost:4242/checkout.html)

## Testing the Application

1. Add an item to a shopping cart

The home page of the application should allow you to manage your cart in a very basic manner. On the dropdown selector there are a few different quantities of avocados that you can choose. Once a quantity is selected, to the right of the dropdown there is a preview of how much it will cost for that specific quantity. You are able to make different selections without actually adding any items. Once you have found the correct amount, you can hit the "Add to Cart" button to add the quantity to your shopping cart. You can continue to add to the cart if you would like to create a larger order. If you have too much in your cart, you can start over by hitting "Empty Cart". Once you are satisfied with your shopping cart you can hit the "Checkout" button.

2. Checkout

After hitting the "Checkout" button you will be redirected to Stripe's pre-built Checkout page. Fill out the information and utilize the test card numbers that Stripe provides.

3. Display Confirmation of Purchase

If the checkout succeeds, the user will be redirected to a confirmation page. This page will list the total amount of the charge and Stripe charge ID (beginning with ch_). 

## Technical Details

Before digging into anything specific I spent time looking at Stripe's development quickstart guide. There I found a great resource for setting up a very basic web application that allowed me to test my account/public and secret keys. Once I had that working, I started looking for code samples that added items to a cart and performed a checkout.  I was able to find Stripe Checkout and the code tutorial that was provided. It was also relatively simple to run that application and see how I could refactor it to be used for my own.  I added a product on the Dashboard that could be used for my application, and once I had the checkout partially working I was able to inspect the JSON in the Developer Tools to figure out where I could find the Stripe Charge ID for the success page. I ended up holding onto the session ID in my sessionStorage object and then got the payment intent from the session ID, and the charge ID from the first charge in the payment intent (since there was just one this was easy). It seemed like there were many different ways to utilize the APIs to create this web application, but this seemed like simplest/least error prone way to do it.

I decided to use Node and Express because although I do not have a ton of deep web development experience, I did remember building a very basic Express app during my undergraduate studies, which helped me get started with this. My basic experience with JavaScript combined with Stripe's well-documented Node examples, allowed me to figure out how to use these frameworks in this specific context.

I thought about a few different possibilities for extending this application in the future. I set up the UI to be a table of produce products--I was thinking that if people wanted avocados from California, they may also want other products such as figs, oranges, and grapes.  I would probably need to refactor the UI to dynamically create the table based on what products are available. Currently, I assume there is an unlimited supply of avocados and I would need to factor in availability in the future iteration. The user would still be able to pick an amount from a dropdown for each product and then hit "Add to Cart" just once for everything selected to be added. On checkout we would need to then make the line items dynamic as well (instead of hard-coding the line item to be avocados).
